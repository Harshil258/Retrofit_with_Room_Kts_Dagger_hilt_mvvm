# 🚀 Retrofit_with_Room_Kts_Dagger_hilt_mvvm

## 📖 Description

This Android project demonstrates how to integrate **Retrofit**, **Room Database**, **Dagger Hilt**, and **MVVM architecture** to create a smooth and efficient Android application. The app fetches a list of posts from a remote API (`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/`), stores the data in a Room database, and displays the data in a `RecyclerView` using `ListAdapter` for smooth animations. The project follows modern Android development practices and uses **Kotlin**, **Coroutines**, and **Android Jetpack components**.

## ✨ Key Features

- **API Integration with Retrofit** 🔌: Fetches posts from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) asynchronously.
- **Room Database for Local Storage** 🗄️: Stores fetched posts in a Room database for offline use.
- **MVVM Architecture** 🏛️: Implements a clean separation of concerns between the Model, View, and ViewModel.
- **Dagger Hilt for Dependency Injection** 💉: Manages dependencies efficiently using Dagger Hilt.
- **RecyclerView with ListAdapter** 🧳: Displays posts with smooth animations using `ListAdapter`.
- **Coroutines** 🌐: Uses Kotlin Coroutines for background threading and asynchronous tasks.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Kotlin** 🟩: Modern programming language for Android development.
- **Retrofit** 🔄: For making network requests and handling the API response.
- **Room Database** 🏠: For local data persistence.
- **MVVM Architecture** 🏗️: For clean separation of UI and data.
- **Dagger Hilt** 🛠️: For dependency injection and managing app components.
- **RecyclerView** 📜: To display a list of posts.
- **ListAdapter** 🎨: For smooth updates and animations in RecyclerView.
- **Coroutines** 💻: For managing background threads and async operations.
